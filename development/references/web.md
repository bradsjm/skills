## Web Design guidelines

CRITICAL: The design system is everything. You should never write custom styles in components, you should always use the design system and customize it and the UI components (including shadcn components) to make them look beautiful with the correct variants. You never use classes like text-white, bg-white, etc. You always use the design system tokens.

- Maximize reusability of components.
- Leverage the index.css and tailwind.config.ts files to create a consistent design system that can be reused across the app instead of custom styles everywhere.
- Create variants in the components you'll use. Shadcn components are made to be customized!
- You review and customize the shadcn components to make them look beautiful with the correct variants.
- CRITICAL: USE SEMANTIC TOKENS FOR COLORS, GRADIENTS, FONTS, ETC. It's important you follow best practices. DO NOT use direct colors like text-white, text-black, bg-white, bg-black, etc. Everything must be themed via the design system defined in the index.css and tailwind.config.ts files!
- Always consider the design system when making changes.
- Pay attention to contrast, color, and typography.
- Always generate responsive designs.
- Beautiful designs are your top priority, so make sure to edit the index.css and tailwind.config.ts files as often as necessary to avoid boring designs and levarage colors and animations.
- Pay attention to dark vs light mode styles of components. You often make mistakes having white text on white background and vice versa. You should make sure to use the correct styles for each mode.

1. **When you need a specific beautiful effect:**
   ```tsx
   // ❌ WRONG - Hacky inline overrides

   // ✅ CORRECT - Define it in the design system
   // First, update index.css with your beautiful design tokens:
   --secondary: [choose appropriate hsl values];  // Adjust for perfect contrast
   --accent: [choose complementary color];        // Pick colors that match your theme
   --gradient-primary: linear-gradient(135deg, hsl(var(--primary)), hsl(var(--primary-variant)));

   // Then use the semantic tokens:
     // Already beautiful!

2. Create Rich Design Tokens:
/* index.css - Design tokens should match your project's theme! */
:root {
   /* Color palette - choose colors that fit your project */
   --primary: [hsl values for main brand color];
   --primary-glow: [lighter version of primary];

   /* Gradients - create beautiful gradients using your color palette */
   --gradient-primary: linear-gradient(135deg, hsl(var(--primary)), hsl(var(--primary-glow)));
   --gradient-subtle: linear-gradient(180deg, [background-start], [background-end]);

   /* Shadows - use your primary color with transparency */
   --shadow-elegant: 0 10px 30px -10px hsl(var(--primary) / 0.3);
   --shadow-glow: 0 0 40px hsl(var(--primary-glow) / 0.4);

   /* Animations */
   --transition-smooth: all 0.3s cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1);
}
3. Create Component Variants for Special Cases:
// In button.tsx - Add variants using your design system colors
const buttonVariants = cva(
   "...",
   {
   variants: {
      variant: {
         // Add new variants using your semantic tokens
         premium: "[new variant tailwind classes]",
         hero: "bg-white/10 text-white border border-white/20 hover:bg-white/20",
         // Keep existing ones but enhance them using your design system
      }
   }
   }
)

**CRITICAL COLOR FUNCTION MATCHING:**

- ALWAYS check CSS variable format before using in color functions
- ALWAYS use HSL colors in index.css and tailwind.config.ts
- If there are rgb colors in index.css, make sure to NOT use them in tailwind.config.ts wrapped in hsl functions as this will create wrong colors.
- NOTE: shadcn outline variants are not transparent by default so if you use white text it will be invisible.  To fix this, create button variants for all states in the design system.

**Beautiful by design**
- Images can be great assets to use in your design. You can use the imagegen tool to generate images. Great for hero images, banners, etc. You prefer generating images over using provided URLs if they don't perfectly match your design. You do not let placeholder images in your design, you generate them. You can also use the web_search tool to find images about real people or facts for example.
- Create files for new components you'll need to implement, do not write a really long index file. Make sure that the component and file names are unique, we do not want multiple components with the same name.
- You may be given some links to known images but if you need more specific images, you should generate them using your image generation tool.
- You should feel free to completely customize the shadcn components or simply not use them at all.
